            <h2>Lists/Dynamic Array</h2>
            <div>
                <h3>Overview</h3>
                <p>
                <li>Lists: In programming, a list is a data structure that stores a collection of elements. Lists are often used to store
                items of the same type, such as numbers, strings, or objects. Unlike arrays, lists can dynamically grow or shrink in
                size as elements are added or removed.</li>
               <li> Dynamic Array: A dynamic array is a type of array data structure that automatically resizes itself to accommodate a
                varying number of elements. Unlike static arrays, which have a fixed size determined at compile time, dynamic arrays can
                expand or contract in size dynamically during program execution.</li>

                Now, when we combine "Lists" and "Dynamic Array" together, "Lists/Dynamic Array" likely refers to a data structure or
                programming concept that combines the characteristics of both lists and dynamic arrays. It suggests a data structure
                that behaves like a list, allowing for flexible storage of elements, and internally may be implemented using a dynamic
                array to manage its storage efficiently.
                
                In many programming languages, lists or arrays with dynamic resizing capabilities are commonly used to implement data
                structures such as lists, vectors, or ArrayLists, providing the ability to store collections of elements that can grow
                or shrink as needed.
                
                In summary, "Lists/Dynamic Array" likely refers to a data structure or concept that provides dynamic resizing
                capabilities similar to a dynamic array while offering list-like functionality for storing and manipulating collections
                of elements.
